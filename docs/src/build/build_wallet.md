## Step 2: Unzip the Downloaded File

1. **Locate the Downloaded Zip File**:
   - Find the downloaded `.zip` file in your Downloads folder or the location where your browser saves downloaded files.

2. **Unzip the File**:
   - Right-click on the `.zip` file and choose `Extract All...` or use your preferred unzipping tool.
   - Choose a location to extract the files to and remember this location.

## Step 3: Install the Extension in Edge/Chrome

1. **Open Microsoft Edge**/**Google Chrome**:
   - Launch the Edge browser on your computer.

2. **Open Extensions Page**:
   - Click on the three dots `...` in the upper right corner of the browser to open the menu.
   - Navigate to `Extensions`. You can also type `edge://extensions/` in the address bar and press Enter.

3. **Enable Developer Mode**:
   - On the Extensions page, look for a toggle or switch labeled `Developer mode` and turn it on.

4. **Load the Unpacked Extension**:
   - Click on the `Load unpacked` button.

You can now get tokens at the [Peregrine Faucet](https://faucet.peregrine.kilt.io/) 

## Conclusion

You've successfully installed the development version of the Sporran wallet extension in Microsoft Edge/Google Chrome. Keep in mind the security prompt after each restart, as it's a standard procedure for extensions loaded in developer mode for security reasons.
