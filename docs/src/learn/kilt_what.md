# What is it for

In today's digital landscape, commonly referred to as Web2, our online experiences often involve navigating numerous websites where several issues can arise. Frequently, these sites require us to log in, prompting us to create an account and share personal details like our name and email address. This information is typically verified through an email confirmation. However, the extent of personal data requested can sometimes be excessive. For instance, some sites may ask for detailed KYC information, such as a passport, even when they only need to confirm basic details like your name, nationality, or legal adult status.

As the internet expanded, the need to manage multiple accounts led to solutions like using Google credentials for logins. This convenience, however, centralized our digital identities, tying access to various services to a single account. Consequently, if a provider like Google suspends or closes your account, access to all services using those credentials is lost. Moreover, centralization poses security risks; data breaches at major companies can expose personal information to malicious parties. Additionally, age verification methods used by online vendors, like simple pop-up confirmations, can be insufficient, potentially leading to legal compliance issues, such as inadvertently selling alcohol to minors.
